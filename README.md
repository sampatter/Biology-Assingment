## Learning github for Fun!

- Q1. When should you use Git for a project?
- A1. git is an exllenct tool for programmers and biologists working with larger data sets or collrabrative projects. This platform allows many collaborators to access a project, such as a pice of code, and provide changes and comments. However version control is avaliable for projects, this means that moderators or collabroators will have a historical record of past versions and there changes. git hub tracks changes between collabroators on a project and is espicially usefull when many vbersions of the same project are being consitently modified. A good rule of thumb for this question is "if you would be upset to loose the work - store it on github". 
- Q2. What kind of files/info should be saved in a Git repository? What types of files/info should not be included in a Git repo?
